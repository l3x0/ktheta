<h2> About </h2> 

This site is not about me, but if you must know I, more or less, can be placed into the following categories: physicist, soil physicist, soil scientist, Earth scientist, and, to some extent, "programmer" (I despise the word "coder")

There is something fundamentally wrong with how science is taught, funded and done. The only remedy is philosophy of science. There is no "scientific method", I am interested in epistemological anarchism and nihilism 

I fully support free and open software, but I am not a hypocrite, commercial platforms can be used to propagate knowledge for free until we have better alternatives

Everything in this site is my opinion, it has nothing to do with the institution I am working at the moment
